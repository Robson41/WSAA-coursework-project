How to Use

Use the form to add new items (name is required).
Items will appear in the list below the form.
Click Edit next to an item to load it into the form for editing.
Click Delete to remove an item (confirmation required).
When editing, submit updates the item instead of creating new.
Messages appear briefly to indicate success or errors.
Notes

Backend validates the name field to prevent empty entries.
Frontend performs the same validation before sending data.
MongoDB stores items with name and description fields.
IDs are handled using MongoDB's ObjectId and converted to string for JSON.
